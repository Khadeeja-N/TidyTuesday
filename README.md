STA258HS Winter 2021 TidyTuesday Data Project
University of Toronto

Tidy Tuesday data project is an on-going group project that is concerned with analysis of data from the TidyTuesday website. 

Step 1 is concerned with describing your selected data for the benefit of someone who has never seen it before and 
statingwhat you are trying to find out. 

Step 2 is concerned with exploring your transformed data in R. You will summarize and visualize variables of interest in your data and
emphasize on the effective communication of the results. You will, therefore, write about the results of your analysis in 
R Markdown to produce a PDF documentof your report. 

Step 3 is concerned with formulating an interesting research question that you can answer using  astatistical inference method that you 
have learned how to run in this course (e.g.,tt-test, regression), and as far as the data permit, answer that question, 
using appropriate graphs and checking of assumptions to support your analysis. Once again, focus on the effective communication 
of your statistical analysis and write a report. UseR Markdown to produce a PDF document of your report. 
Write a report that tells the story of your analysis.Your report should also have a conclusion that summarizes what you have found. 
Imagine that you are writing a report that other students in the class will want to read; this is the audience you are aiming for. 
Include your code somewhere in your report; this can be next to your output, or you can move it to an appendix of your report if 
you think that makes it read more smoothly.
